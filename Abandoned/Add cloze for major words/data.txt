Fair is foul, and foul is fair:<br>Hover through the fog and filthy air.	
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--	
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!	
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.	
Stars, hide your fires;<br>Let not light see my black and deep desires	
yet do I fear thy nature;<br>It is too full o' the milk of human kindness<br>To catch the nearest way	
Come, you spirits<br>That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,<br>And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full<br>Of direst cruelty!	
look like the innocent flower,<br>But be the serpent under't	
We will proceed no further in this business:<br>He hath honour'd me of late	
I dare do all that may become a man;<br>Who dares do more is none	
I would, while it was smiling in my face,<br>Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,<br>And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn	
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,<br>And we'll not fail	
False face must hide what the false heart doth know	
Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br>The handle toward my hand?	
I had most need of blessing, and 'amen'<div>Stuck in my throat.</div>	
Glamis hath murder'd sleep and therefore Cawdor<br>Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.	
I am afraid to think what I have done	
My hands are of your colour; but I shame<br>To wear a heart so white.	
To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself	
There's daggers in men's smiles	
I fear,<div>Thou play'dst most foully for't</div>	
I require a clearness: and with him--<br>To leave no rubs nor botches in the work	
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!	
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck	
I am in blood<br>Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,<br>Returning were as tedious as go o'er	
Double, double toil and trouble,<br>Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.	
Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn<div>The power of man, for none of woman born</div><div>Shall harm Macbeth.</div>	
When our actions do not,<div>Our fears do make us traitors.</div>	
Out, damned spot! out, I say!	
unnatural deeds<br>Do breed unnatural troubles	
Those he commands move only in command,<br>Nothing in love: now does he feel his title<br>Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe<br>Upon a dwarfish thief.	
And that which should accompany old age,<br>As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,<br>I must not look to have	
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;	
I have supp'd full with horrors	
Out, out, brief candle!<br>Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br>And then is heard no more	
I will not yield,<div>To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet</div>	
this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
